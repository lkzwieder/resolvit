# Resolvit test for the technical interview.
Technical interview exercise for Resolvit

## How to install
This was created and tested using NodeJS 9.4.0 and the libraries was installed using
NPM 5.6.0, you have to make sure your NodeJS and NPM versions are compatible.

Step by step:
- npm install
- npm test #This is optional
- npm start

## To fix
- filter must be a stem and could not be an stem right now.

## To improve
- the use of classes (not prototyped classes), import and export.
- make the solution scalable with a strategy for big texts like books.
This could be achieved with streams

## To do
- complete all the test cases.
- load from files or urls

# To have into account
I'm not used to creating tests, can be helpful for any kind of developers but
is kind of 'new' for old developers like me, and I've always felt that this 
kind of test works against my coding speed.
